**About this YOLOv10 object Detection Model**

  YOLO v10 is a real-time object detection model that identifies multiple objects in images or videos. It uses advanced neural networks to detect objects quickly and accurately, making it ideal for tasks like surveillance, autonomous driving, or security applications. YOLO v10 improves speed and precision over its predecessors.


**About coco DataSet using "yolov10x.pt" pretrained model**

  The COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection dataset containing images of 80 different classes like people, animals, and everyday objects. The yolov10x.pt model, pre-trained on this dataset, can quickly detect and classify these objects in images or videos, making it effective for tasks like detecting cars, animals, and humans with high accuracy.

**Set the image and video paths**

    1. image_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/your_image.jpg"  # Replace with your actual image path
    2. video_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/your_video.mp4"  # Replace with your actual video path
